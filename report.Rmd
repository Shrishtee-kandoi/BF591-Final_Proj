## 1.  Reading in Sample Metadata

To begin, we first want to read in our project metadata and expression data. Using
`tidyverse` packages, read in the sample metadata file, `proj_metadata.csv`, and
return the head of the **first five** columns of the `tibble`.

```{r, message=FALSE}
metadata <- readr::read_csv("data/proj_metadata.csv")
knitr::kable(head(metadata)[c(1:5)])
```

## 2. Reading in Expression Data

Reading the expression matrix is more complicated. In the supplied R script,
implement the `read_expression_table` function to properly handle the format
of `example_intensity_data.csv`, including specifying the value delimiter,
transposing the matrix so samples are rows and probes are columns, and likewise
ensure a `tibble` object is returned.
```{r}
expr_mat <- read_expression_table('data/example_intensity_data.csv')
knitr::kable(head(expr_mat[c(1:5)]))
```

## 3. Formatting Column Names 

The column names of the metadata file contain various delimiters, including "."
and "_". Standardize this by implementing the function `period_to_underscore` to
properly replace all instances of "." with "_" in a string. Using a functional
programming paradigm, apply this function to each column name in the metadata
`tibble` and replace the column names.

**Hint:** there are several possible solutions to this problem. Feel free to 
Google possible ways to manipulate strings in `R`. One possible way is to use
regular expressions and the `stringr` library. 
```{r}
colnames(metadata) <-
  lapply(colnames(metadata), period_to_underscore)
colnames(metadata)
```

## 4. Renaming and Selecting Columns of interest

Using `dplyr` renaming and selecting to columns of interest is very straight
forward. Implement the `rename_and_select` function to rename and select columns
as the specified columns. Return the head of the newly formatted and subsetted
`tibble`. 

**Columns to rename**:

1. "Age_at_diagnosis" to "Age"
2. "SixSubtypesClassification" to "Subtype"
3. "normalizationcombatbatch" to "Batch"

**Columns to select**: "Sex", "Age", "TNM_Stage", "Tumor_Location",
"geo_accession", "KRAS_Mutation", "Subtype", "Batch"

```{r}
selected_metadata <- rename_and_select(metadata)
colnames(selected_metadata)
```

## Creating New Columns using `dplyr::mutate`
There are often times when we may wish to create new columns in our data based
off of values in previously existing columns. Implement the `stage_as_factor`
function to create a new `Stage` column where each integer value in the original
`TNM_Stage` column is prefixed by "stage". Ensure the the column is stored as a
factor variable.

```{r}
selected_metadata <- stage_as_factor(selected_metadata)
selected_metadata$Stage
```

## 5. Average Age by Sex

Often times we'll want to calculate summary statistics for different groups.
Implement the `mean_age_by_sex` function to properly filter your metadata tibble
using a specified sex (possible values for this dataset are "M" and "F").
Calculate the average age for both subject categories.

```{r}
male_age <-  mean_age_by_sex(selected_metadata, "M")
female_age <-  mean_age_by_sex(selected_metadata, "F")
print(paste0("The average male age is: ", round(male_age, digits=2)))
print(paste0("The average female age is: ", round(female_age, digits=2)))
```

## 6. Grouping Data
While filtering datasets by individual values is a viable method, we may often
was to summarize our data across multiple groups. The `group_by` method from
`dplyr` allows easy grouping of data `tibbles`, and the `summarise` function
allows the easy calculations grouped statistics. Using the newly created `Stage`
column, use both functions to find the average age of samples within each cancer
stage, and count the number of co-occurrences between cancer subtype and cancer
progression. Implement these methods in the `age_by_stage` and
`subtype_stage_cross_tab` functions, respectively.

```{r}
age_by_stage(selected_metadata)
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
subtype_stage_cross_tab(selected_metadata)
```

## 7. Selecting Interesting Features in Expression Data

Often during analysis we will want to select interesting features or genes to
explore more in-depth. For example, we may be interested in the most __highly__
expressed genes, or perhaps the most __variable__ genes. Implement the function
`summarize_expression()` to create a new `tibble` with average probe expression
 (denoted "mean_exp").

 **Hint:** There are several functions in base R that can be used for common
 analysis steps. For example, `rowMeans()` or `colMeans`, can be used to 
 calculate row or column-wise averages.

 **Extra:** instead of simply returning mean probe expression, re-work
 `summarize_expression()` to also return prove _variability_ by first calculating
 prove-wise variability across all samples, and adding the column to the
 returned `tibble`. Denote the column as "variance". 

```{r}
summarized <- summarize_expression(expr_mat)
knitr::kable(head(summarized))
```

Using `dplyr::top_n` and `dplyr::arrange`, report the top ten mostly highly
expressed probes, as well as the top ten most variable.

```{r}
highest_exp <- dplyr::top_n(summarized, 10, mean_exp) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(mean_exp))
print(paste0("The most highly expressed probes are ", paste(highest_exp$probe, collapse=', ')))

if (c('variance') %in% colnames(summarized)) {
  most_variable <- dplyr::top_n(summarized, 10, variance) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(variance))
  print(paste0("The most variable probes are ", paste(most_variable$probe, collapse=',')))
}

```

## 8. Re-using Functions to Save Time and to Modularize Code

If you looked into the samples present in the sample metadata, as well as the
expression matrix, you may have realized not all samples in the expression data
are found in the metadata. First, subset the metadata file to only include
samples found in the expression matrix. Next, using our previously defined
functions, calculate the same summary statistics we calculated previously (i.e.
average age by sex, age of samples by cancer progression, and finally the stage
and cancer subtype co-occurrences).
```{r, message=FALSE}
sub_meta <-
  dplyr::filter(selected_metadata, geo_accession %in% expr_mat$subject_id)

print(paste0("The average male age is: ", round(mean_age_by_sex(sub_meta, "M"), digits=2)))
print(paste0("The average female age is: ", round(mean_age_by_sex(sub_meta, "F"), digits=2)))
print(age_by_stage(sub_meta))
subtype_stage_cross_tab(sub_meta)
```
